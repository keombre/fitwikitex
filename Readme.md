# Fit-WiKi TeX Fixer

Are latex images missing from fit-wiki?

Use this one easy fix!

Sysadmins hate him for using this simple trick!

# Install

This is Chrome extension. If you don't use Chrome, you can easily port this to GreaseMonkey, or what have you.
I won't be publishing this to the chrome dev store.

 1. `git clone https://github.com/keombre/fitwikitex`
 2. Open chrome://extensions
 3. In top-right corner enable developer mode
 4. In top-left corder select "Load unpacked extension"
 5. Navigate to the folder, where you cloned this repo
 6. You're all set! Enjoy ;)
